## What does the name 'ZenithFlux' mean?

A simple, surface-level meaning could be "something that is constantly changing even though it's at the top".  
The actual meaning of this name is quite abstract and ineffable. Even though I came up with the name myself, I have never been able to properly describe it to others.

<summary>Here is an LLM generated description, which is much closer to the true meaning than I could ever get:</summary>

> The name Zenithflux is a striking compound word that blends the concept of absolute heights with the energy of constant movement. Since it isn’t a standard dictionary word, its meaning comes from how those two powerful roots interact.

> ##### 1. The Core Components  
> To understand the whole, we have to look at the two halves:
>
> **Zenith**: This is the highest point reached by a celestial object directly above an observer. Figuratively, it represents the pinnacle, the summit, or the time at which something is most powerful or successful.  
> **Flux**: This refers to continuous change, flow, or movement. In physics, it describes the rate of flow of a fluid, radiant energy, or particles across a given area.
> 
> ##### Combined Interpretations
> The name creates a fascinating paradox by pairing "zenith"—a static point of ultimate achievement—with "flux"—the state of constant motion and change. When you put them together, you get a few different philosophical and technical "flavors":
> 
> **Evolving Excellence**  
> Usually, reaching a "zenith" implies you’ve arrived at the end—there is nowhere higher to go. Adding "flux" suggests that even at the top, there is constant motion and evolution. It implies a person or brand that stays at the peak of their game by never standing still.
> 
> **Peak Energy Flow**  
> In a technical or scientific context, ZenithFlux could represent the maximum rate of energy transfer. Imagine the moment the sun is directly overhead (zenith) and its radiation is at its strongest (flux). It suggests intensity, power, and high output.
> 
> **The Cycle of Success**  
> Since flux implies change, the name could represent the "ebb and flow" of reaching high points. It’s a humble reminder that life moves in cycles—sometimes you are at the peak, and that peak itself is a fluid, moving target.
